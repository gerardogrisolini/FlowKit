# FlowKit
Framework per la creazione di applicazioni modulari

### Getting Started
FlowKit primarily uses SwiftPM as its build tool, so we recommend using that as well. If you want to depend on FlowKit in your own project, it's as simple as adding a dependencies clause to your Package.swift:
```
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/gerardogrisolini/FlowKit.git", branch: "main")
]
```
